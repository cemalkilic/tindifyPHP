# Tindify

Tindify is an app which helps you discover new songs! 

It simply grabs a random playlist from your owned/followed playlists, then gives you a 30 second clip to hear. If you like it, the track will be added to a Spotify playlist called Tindify on your account. If you do not like it, move on to the next song or next playlist!

Live demo can be found **[here](http://tindify.cemalkilic.net)**.
